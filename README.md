This is a small image viewer that aims to be good looking and provide basic funtionality. It is entirely made using PySide6. Feel free to use this in your own projects, as an example project or however you like.

## Credits

- I used a  modified version of this [Image viewer widget](https://github.com/marcel-goldschen-ohm/PyQtImageViewer)
- I used [qt_material](https://github.com/UN-GCPDS/qt-material) to make everything look good
